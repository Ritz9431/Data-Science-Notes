It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError error.\n\n'w' - Write mode: It opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates its contents. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n\n'a' - Append mode: It opens the file for appending. If the file already exists, it appends new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n\n'x' - Exclusive creation mode: It opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it raises a FileExistsError error. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n\n't' - Text mode: This is the default mode. It opens the file in text mode for reading or writing.\n\n'b' - Binary mode: It opens the file in binary mode for reading or writing.\n\n'+' - Update mode: It opens the file for both reading and writing.\n\nThese modes can be combined to create the desired file opening behavior. For example, 'rb' opens the file in binary mode for reading, and 'w+' opens the file in update mode for reading and writing, and truncates the file if it exists.",
